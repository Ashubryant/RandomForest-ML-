# Random Forest Predictive Model

This project demonstrates the application of a **Random Forest Classifier** for predictive modeling using Python. The goal is to build a robust machine learning model capable of classifying outcomes based on structured data.

## Project Overview

The notebook walks through the standard machine learning pipeline:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing
- Model building using Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluation of model performance
- Prediction on test data

## Key Features
- Utilizes `scikit-learn` for machine learning
- Easy-to-follow structure with minimal code comments
- Clean and general-purpose implementation for reusability
- Focused on interpretability and performance evaluation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible IDE.
3. Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the results.
